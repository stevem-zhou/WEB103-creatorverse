## Notes

Some challenges that I encountered were trying to figure out how to have the main page become real-time in updates, without having to refresh after the user has editted or posted anything new. I soon found out it was because of my dependecy array which intially only ran once. Another challenge would be styling with PicoCSS, where initially I tried to edit parts of the website with normall css, but it wouldn't work unless I created class names for each element. I learned a lot and developed my ability to navigate through documentations to figure out my problems.
